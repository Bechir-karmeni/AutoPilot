# Description
> The goal of the project was to train a Deep Network to replicate the human steering behavior while driving, thus being able to drive autonomously on a simulator provided by Udacity. To this purpose, the network takes as input the frame of the frontal camera (say, a roof-mounted camera) and predicts the steering direction at each instant.

# The dataset
> Data for this task can be gathered with the Udacity simulator itself. Indeed, when the simulator is set to training mode, the car is controlled by the human though the keyboard, and frames and steering directions are stored to disk. For those who want to avoid this process, Udacity made also available an "off-the-shelf" training set. For this project, I employed this latter.Udacity training set is constituted by 8036 samples. For each sample, two main information are provided:
.three frames from the frontal, left and right camera respectively
.the corresponding steering direction
